    A closure that checks if a function has a docstring of sufficient length before executing it.

    This function verifies that the passed function `fn` has a docstring that is more than 50 characters
    long (excluding spaces). If the docstring meets this requirement, the function is executed. Otherwise,
    a ValueError is raised.

    Args:
        fn (function): The function to be checked and potentially executed.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the passed argument is not a function or is a class type.
        ValueError: If the function's docstring is missing or shorter than 50 characters.

    Returns:
        function: The inner function that enforces the docstring length check before calling the original function.

    Example:
        @checker
